Assumptions
===========
o To use the AWS CLI commands, your CLI must be properly configured with AWS credentials.


GitHub and Amazon S3 files
==========================
o All files are in Github:
  https://github.com/paulwhittemore/fizzbuzz_aws

o CloudFormation Template uploaded to S3:
  https://s3.amazonaws.com/pmw-fizzbuzz-aws/fizzbuzz_aws.json


Create Test-FizzBuzz Stack
==========================
o Create the stack using your key.

# Create the stack.
$ aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name Test-FizzBuzz --template-url https://s3.amazonaws.com/pmw-fizzbuzz-aws/fizzbuzz_aws.json --parameters ParameterKey=KeyName,ParameterValue=<Key Name>


# Check that the stack has been created.
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Test-FizzBuzz --query Stacks[0].StackStatus
"CREATE_IN_PROGRESS"  # Still working.
"CREATE_COMPLETE"     # Stack ready to use.


Test the Test-FizzBuzz Stack
============================
o Get the hostname of the Test-FizzBuzz stack's Load Balancer.
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Test-FizzBuzz --query Stacks[0].Outputs[0].OutputValue


# Sanity Test
o You can do a sanity check of the stack using a browser, or curl.

$ curl http://<ELB hostname>:5000/            # Returns Hello, World!
$ curl http://<ELB hostname>:5000/fizzbuzz/15 # Returns FizzBuzz value for 15 (any integer can be used)


# Load Test -- Scale Up/Scale Down
o Clone the fizzbuzz_aws repository.

$ git clone https://github.com/paulwhittemore/fizzbuzz_aws.git
$ cd fizzbuzz_aws/src

o Run the load generator script.
$ python load_generator.py --host=<ELB hostname>

Note: The load generation script doesn't have any error handling in it.
      Occassionally the script will fail when a connection is dropped.
      In these cases, try re-running the script.

      Error: socket.error: [Errno 54] Connection reset by peer

o Monitoring
  - Its easiest to use the LoadBalancer console window for monitoring.
  - Add CloudWatch monitoring for an individual ELB -- the Request Count metric (track with Statistic: Sum).
  - During the test, the "Healthy Hosts (with Statistic: Maximum)" should go from 2->3->4->3->2.
  - These transitions should lag changes in ELB Request Count by a couple of minutes.
    - As Request Count passes 100 per minute, a host will be added until there are 4 hosts.
      - Test-FizzBuzz-HighRequestCountAlarm triggers and causes host to be added.
    - As Request Count drops to less than 10 per minute, hosts will be dropped until there are 2 hosts.
      - Test-FizzBuzz-LowRequestCountAlarm triggers and causes host to be terminated.


Delete the Test-FizzBuzz Stack
==============================

o Delete the stack

# Delete stack.
$ aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name Test-FizzBuzz


# Check for progress.
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks --stack-name Test-FizzBuzz --query Stacks[0].StackStatus
"DELETE_IN_PROGRESS"  # Still working.

# List stacks -- Test-FizzBuzz should not be there after deletion.
$ aws cloudformation describe-stacks
{
    "Stacks": []
}
